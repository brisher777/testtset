separate function to cycle through 2 variables that can be called at anytime
loop through until parsed output == input
if expected output isn't parsed, call 3 variable function
to parse:  grep code, find first instance of : parse til <, strip whitespace, work with string

possibly make a 4 variable funtion

same function but with a third variable to test output when expected value isnt returned

loop user input char by char
	pass each char to loop function
	print each char to STDOUT and append it to a string for storage
